# Burstcoin Toolkit for rustlang.

## What is this?
This kit is intended to provide burstcoin-specific utility code in a library form
for rust applications.

## What isn't this?
This kit does not implement anything that can be found in the rust ecosystem already, such as
various types of cryptography.

For Elliptical Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH), [x25519-dalek] is recommended.
